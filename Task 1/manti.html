    <h2>Turkish Manti Is The Best</h2>
    <p>These small dumplings called manti are mainly known from the Turkish cuisine but they are also a national dish in
        Kazakhstan and eaten in Russia, Ukraine, and other countries where they also come in different shapes. You can
        buy dry manti in Turkish supermarkets, even filled with soy, but they often contain eggs, so that's why we
        wanted to make a vegan version of Turkish manti for our dumpling week. We watched and read a lot of recipes,
        videos, and instructions for folding techniques - the latter taking up the most time, for sure.</p>
    <p>The dough is prepared quickly and needs some rest - time that you can use to prepare the filling. Traditionally,
        manti are filled with minced meat, which has a kind of sticky texture, making it easy to fold the dough around
        it. For the vegan filling, you have to chop the soy meat and all other ingredients finely, as only half a
        teaspoon fits into the dumplings. To get this sticky texture, we've added tomato paste - don't skip this,
        because the dry ingredients only would just fall out of the dumplings. To fold manti, we used the following
        method: Hold a square piece of the dough in your hands, start by pressing the two left corners together, then
        the two right ones. Now fold these two corners towards the middle and press to seal. Youtube videos helped us a
        lot in the beginning! Since you'll fold a hundred and more manti, this will take some time, so maybe just ask
        friends over...</p>
